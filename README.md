# Scout Project
FRC scouting client app (Scout) and data visualization and analysis app (Scout Insights) created for the 2022 season.

## Overview

### Scout Insights
The Scout Insights app can be used on an iPad. It is used to aggregate match data gathered on Scout and calculate and visualize statistics. Data is acquired by scanning the QR code generated by the Scout app.
