# Scout Project
FRC scouting client app (Scout) and data visualization and analysis app (Scout Insights) created for the 2022 season.

## Overview
### Scout
The Scout app can be used on Android tablets to gather match data. Once the data for a match is gathered, it is compressed into a QR code that can be scanned from the Scout Insights app.

### Scout Insights
The Scout Insights app can be used on an iPad. It is used to aggregate match data gathered on Scout and calculate and visualize statistics. Data is acquired by scanning the QR code generated by the Scout app.

## TODO (in order of priority)
Scout Insights
1. add page for statistics (per robot / all robots combined)
2. order scouting sheets by match number
3. clean SheetInfoView
4. avoid crash when bad qr code is detected

Scout
1. add safety on textfields (currently allowed to send sheet with no match number / team number which makes Scout Insights crash)
